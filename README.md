Regression and Classification problems

1. House Price was predicted using Linear Regression (Regression algorithm).
2. Breast Cancer was predicted using Logistic Regression (Classification algorithm).


               | Positive Prediction | Negative Prediction
               
Positive Class | True Positive (TP)  | False Negative (FN)

Negative Class | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN)


Precision = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalsePositives)


Recall = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalseNegatives)


F-Measure = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
