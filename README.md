Regression and Classification problems

1. House Price was predicted using Linear Regression (Regression algorithm).
2. Breast Cancer was predicted using Logistic Regression (Classification algorithm).
3. Gender Voice prediction using Support Vector Machine

               | Positive Prediction | Negative Prediction
               
Positive Class | True Positive (TP)  | False Negative (FN)

Negative Class | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN)


Precision = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalsePositives)


Recall = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalseNegatives)


F-Measure = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
